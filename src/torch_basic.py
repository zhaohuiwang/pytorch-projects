PyTorch is based on Torch, a framework for doing fast computation that is written in C. Torch has a Lua (means "Moon" in Portuguese) wrapper for constructing models.

One of the main special features of PyTorch is that it adds a C++ module for autodifferentiation to the Torch backend using torch.autograd engine. 
By default, PyTorch uses eager mode computation. Same as the Keras

First, we instantiate the LeNet class, and we print the net object. A subclass of torch.nn.Module will report the layers it has created and their shapes and parameters. This can provide a handy overview of a model if you want to get the gist of its processing.

Below that, we create a dummy input representing a 32x32 image with 1 color channel. Normally, you would load an image tile and convert it to a tensor of this shape.

You may have noticed an extra dimension to our tensor - the batch dimension. PyTorch models assume they are working on batches of data - for example, a batch of 16 of our image tiles would have the shape (16, 1, 32, 32). Since we're only using one image, we create a batch of 1 with shape (1, 1, 32, 32).

We ask the model for an inference by calling it like a function: net(input). The output of this call represents the model's confidence that the input represents a particular digit. (Since this instance of the model hasn't learned anything yet, we shouldn't expect to see any signal in the output.) Looking at the shape of output, we can see that it also has a batch dimension, the size of which should always match the input batch dimension. If we had passed in an input batch of 16 instances, output would have a shape of (16, 10).

Build the Neural Network

https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/buildmodel_tutorial.html

Neural networks comprise of layers/modules that perform operations on data. The torch.nn namespace provides all the building blocks you need to build your own neural network. Every module in PyTorch subclasses the nn.Module. A neural network is a module itself that consists of other modules (layers). This nested structure allows for building and managing complex architectures easily.

a neural network to classify images in the FashionMNIST dataset

Get Device for Training
We want to be able to train our model on a hardware accelerator like the GPU or MPS (Mac M1/M2/M3), if available. Let's check to see if torch.cuda or torch.backends.mps are available, otherwise we use the CPU.

Define the Class
We define our neural network by subclassing nn.Module, and initialize the neural network layers in __init__. Every nn.Module subclass implements the operations on input data in the forward method.

CLASS
torch.nn.Linear(in_features, out_features, bias=True, device=None, dtype=None)
Applies an affine linear transformation to the incoming data: 
y = xA^T + b
weight A of shape (out_features, in_features) and bias b of shape (out_features) are learnable variables, when bias=True.


Model Parameters
Many layers inside a neural network are parameterized, i.e. have associated weights and biases that are optimized during training. Subclassing nn.Module automatically tracks all fields defined inside your model object, and makes all parameters accessible using your model's parameters() or named_parameters() methods.

Calling the model on the input returns a 2-dimensional tensor with dim=0 corresponding to each output of n (10 in this example) raw predicted values for each class, and dim=1 corresponding to the individual values of each output.

The logits raw values are in [-infty, infty], nn.Softmax module applies the normalized exponential function to convert the logits values into a probability distribution of K possible outcomes in the range of [0, 1].
